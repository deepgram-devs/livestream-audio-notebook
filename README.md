# Livestream Audio Notebook

Use your favorite interactive notebook platform to run this quickstart, which guides you through using the Deepgram API and Deepgram's Python SDK to transcribe live-streamed audio into text.

This notebook shows how to make a streaming speech-to-text request. We also have a notebook which shows how to make a [prerecorded audio](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/prerecorded-audio-notebook) speech-to-text request.
